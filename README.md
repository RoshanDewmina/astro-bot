# AstroBot üåå
- AstroBot is an interactive orrery that brings the solar system to life, allowing users to explore planets, Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) in real-time. This educational tool combines scientific accuracy with an interactive 3D visualization and a custom AI chatbot to provide a fun, engaging way to learn about our solar system.

# Final Project üåê
- [Explore AstroBot](https://www.roshan-and-cs-friends.co/)

# What it Does üöÄ

- Interactive Visualization: Displays orbits of planets and celestial bodies around the Sun using a 3D model of the solar system.
- Customizable Experience: Users can adjust the number of NEOs displayed with a dynamic slider.
- Detailed Information: Click on planets, asteroids, or other celestial bodies to view data like eccentricity, semi-major axis, and orbital period.
- AI Chatbot: Our custom-built AI chatbot answers questions about planets, NEOs, and other space objects.

# How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

- Keplerian Equations: Simulates elliptical orbits for scientific accuracy.
- Interactive Interface: Zoom, pan, and rotate to explore the solar system from different angles. Use sliders and clickable objects for a hands-on experience.
- NASA Open Data: We integrated accurate data from NASA‚Äôs public datasets for celestial body positions.
- AI Chatbot: Uses the Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI, pgvector, and Postgres to deliver real-time answers based on space data.

# Benefits üìö
- Educational Value: AstroBot simplifies complex astronomical concepts, making them more accessible to students, teachers, and space enthusiasts.
- Exploration & Curiosity: Interactive exploration fosters curiosity and deepens understanding of the cosmos.
- Accessible Learning: The intuitive interface and AI chatbot ensure that space education is approachable for users of all ages and backgrounds.

# What we Hope to Achieve ‚ú®
- We aim to make space exploration exciting, engaging, and educational for everyone. Our goal is to spark curiosity about the cosmos and provide users with a deeper understanding of our solar system. We hope that AstroBot becomes a go-to tool for educators, students, and anyone interested in astronomy, helping them learn and explore in a fun, interactive way.

# Future Potential üå†
- Expansion Plans: We aim to include comets, spacecraft trajectories, and real-time NASA data for a more dynamic exploration tool.
- Classroom Integration: We plan to develop educational modules to make AstroBot a valuable resource in schools.
